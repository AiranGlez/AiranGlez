### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Airan Gonzalez, and I am a computer system administrator and a novice application developer. I am originally from the Canary Islands, in Spain, and I am recently working as a Linux systems and cloud computing administrator, specialized in technologies such as Docker, Openstack, Kubernetes and others. In my free time, I really enjoy playing music and videogames, taking walks through the forest and reading.
